# Oil Field Equipment Monitoring System

## Overview
A time monitoring and analytics system that processes oil-field equipment sensor data to detect anomalies and predict potential failures.

## Tech Stack
- Python (data ingestion, anomaly detection)
- SQL (ETL, schema design, querying)
- Power BI (dashboarding and visualization)

## Features
- Automated sensor data ingestion
- Anomaly detection logic for early failure signals
- SQL-based data storage and querying
- Interactive dashboards for equipment health monitoring

## Use Case
Designed to help maintenance teams identify abnormal equipment behavior early, reducing downtime and improving maintenance planning.

## Notes
This project uses simulated sensor data to demonstrate real-world analytics workflows.
